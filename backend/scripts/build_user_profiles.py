Before running, ask: do you need this script?

You need this script if:
    ✔ Your stored profiles get out of sync
    ✔ You want to batch-rebuild all user profiles based on their historical queries
    ✔ You want to test the output of build_user_profile on all users
    ✔ You run it as a maintenance job

You do not need it if:
    ✘ You always compute profiles dynamically through the API
    ✘ You don’t store implicit interests permanently
    ✘ You don’t need batch regeneration
    ✘ Profiles are up-to-date automatically through interactions
